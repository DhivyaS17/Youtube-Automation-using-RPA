# Youtube-Automation-using-RPA
The purpose of this bot is to get the details of the top songs of the week from a website using data scraping and thereby getting a DataTable of all the latest hits in 
the language specified by the user. Then the songs from the list will be searched in YouTube and then it will add to the existing playlist. If the 
playlist doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created first and then the songs will be added. On creating a new playlist the setting of the playlist will be set in 
such a way that the new songs will be placed at the top of the list and they will be played first when the playlist is played. The addition of songs to the 
playlist will be skipped if it already existed in the playlist.
